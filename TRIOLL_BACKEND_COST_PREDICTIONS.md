## Appendix A: Cost Calculation Formulas

### Stream Cost Formula
```
Total Stream Cost = API Gateway Cost + Lambda Cost + DynamoDB Cost + 
                   S3 Cost + (Bandwidth Ã CDN Rate) + 
                   Processing Cost + Analytics Cost
```

### Monthly Infrastructure Cost
```
Monthly Cost = (MAU Ã Avg Sessions Ã Stream Cost) + 
               Base Infrastructure + 
               (Storage GB Ã Storage Rate) +
               Support Costs
```

### ROI Calculation
```
ROI = (Revenue per User - Cost per User) / Cost per User Ã 100
Break-even MAU = Fixed Costs / (Revenue per User - Variable Cost per User)
```
