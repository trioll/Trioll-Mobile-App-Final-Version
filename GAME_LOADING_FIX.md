# Game Loading Issue Fix - Developer Portal Games

## Issue Summary
Games uploaded through the developer portal (like Cannon Shot and Horror Pong) weren't loading in the mobile app when users clicked play.

## Root Cause
The games API was filtering out games from the developer portal's CloudFront distribution:
- Developer portal uses: `dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net`
- Games API only allowed: `dk72g9i0333mv.cloudfront.net` and S3 direct URLs

## Fix Applied
Updated the `filterTriollGames` function in `games-api.js` to include the developer portal's CloudFront domain:

```javascript
const validDomains = [
  'trioll-prod-games-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com',
  'dk72g9i0333mv.cloudfront.net',
  'dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net' // Developer portal CloudFront domain
];
```

## How Game Loading Works

1. **Game Upload (Developer Portal)**:
   - Developer uploads game files at triolldev.com
   - Files are stored in S3 bucket
   - Developer portal provides CloudFront URL: `https://dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net/{gameId}/index.html`

2. **Game Discovery (Mobile App)**:
   - App fetches games from `/games` endpoint
   - API filters games to only include those from allowed domains
   - Games are displayed in the feed

3. **Game Loading (Trial Player)**:
   - User clicks play button
   - App first tries to get a presigned S3 URL via API
   - If that fails, falls back to the game's `trialUrl` (CloudFront URL)
   - WebView loads the game from the URL

## Current CloudFront Distributions

1. **dk72g9i0333mv.cloudfront.net** - "Trioll Mobile Global CDN"
   - Used as default in `transformGame` function
   - Historical/legacy CDN

2. **dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net** - Developer Portal CDN
   - Used by games uploaded through triolldev.com
   - Now allowed in the API filter

3. **d2wg7sn99og2se.cloudfront.net** - Mentioned in docs
   - Possibly another CDN configuration
   - Not currently in use

## Current Architecture (Working as Intended)

The system uses two CloudFront distributions by design:
1. **Developer Portal CDN** (`dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net`) - For games uploaded by developers
2. **Legacy CDN** (`dk72g9i0333mv.cloudfront.net`) - For any pre-existing or system games

This separation is intentional and provides:
- Clear separation between developer-uploaded content and system content
- Independent scaling and configuration for each use case
- Better tracking of game sources

## Recommendations

1. **Keep Current Architecture**:
   - The two-CDN approach is working correctly
   - Both domains are now properly allowed in the API
   - No consolidation needed

3. **Add Health Checks**:
   - Add endpoint to verify game URLs are accessible
   - Add monitoring for 403/404 errors when loading games

4. **Document CDN Configuration**:
   - Create clear documentation about which CDN to use
   - Update all hardcoded URLs to use environment variables

## Testing the Fix

1. The fix has been deployed to production
2. Try loading Cannon Shot and Horror Pong again in the mobile app
3. Games should now appear and load properly
4. If issues persist, check:
   - CloudWatch logs for the games API
   - Network tab in app to see actual URLs being requested
   - S3 bucket permissions for the game files

## Future Improvements

1. **Automatic CDN Detection**: Instead of filtering by domain, validate that game files actually exist
2. **Unified CDN Strategy**: Migrate all games to use a single CloudFront distribution
3. **Better Error Messages**: Provide clear feedback when games fail to load
4. **Presigned URL Support**: Ensure all games can be accessed via presigned URLs for better security
