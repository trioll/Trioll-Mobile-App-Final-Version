# App Store Submission Guide - Trioll Mobile

## üì± Quick Setup Timeline: 1-2 Hours Total

### Part 1: Production Keystore (30 minutes)

#### For Android (Google Play)

1. **Generate Keystore** (5 minutes):
```bash
cd "/Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/Trioll Mobile App Final Version/trioll-consumer-app/android/app"

# Generate production keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore trioll-release.keystore -alias trioll -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (save this!)
# - Your name
# - Organization unit
# - Organization
# - City/Locality
# - State/Province
# - Country code (US)
```

2. **Configure Gradle** (5 minutes):
Create `android/keystore.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=trioll
storeFile=trioll-release.keystore
```

3. **Update build.gradle** (already configured in most React Native apps)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: 
- Back up `trioll-release.keystore` in multiple secure locations
- Save passwords in a password manager
- You CANNOT recover if lost!

#### For iOS (App Store)

iOS signing is handled automatically by Expo EAS Build:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI if not already installed
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure your project
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS (handles certificates automatically)
eas build --platform ios
```
