# RPG Stats Grid Implementation

## Overview
Successfully transformed the existing stats grid in ProfileScreen from raw numbers to engaging RPG-style attributes while preserving the glassmorphic design and grid layout.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created RPGStatsGrid Component ‚úÖ
**File**: `components/profile/RPGStatsGrid.tsx`

The new component transforms raw stats into 6 RPG attributes:

```typescript
üí™ STRENGTH      - Based on likes given (shows player engagement)
üéØ ACCURACY      - Based on hours played (precision from experience)
üß† INTELLIGENCE  - Based on ratings given (wisdom from evaluating games)
üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE       - Based on current streak (daily consistency)
‚ö° SPEED         - Based on trials played (gaming velocity)
‚ú® CHARISMA      - Based on games shared/completed (social influence)
```

**Features**:
- Maintains exact same 2x3 grid layout
- Glass container styling preserved
- Emoji icons for visual appeal
- Level calculation (every 50 points = 1 level)
- Progress bars showing advancement to next level
- Color-coded attributes for quick recognition

### 2. Updated Guest Stats Interface ‚úÖ
**File**: `types/guest.ts`

Added RPG stat fields to `GuestStats`:
```typescript
export interface GuestStats {
  // Existing fields...
  // RPG stats
  likesGiven?: number;
  totalTimeSpentMinutes?: number;
  hoursPlayed?: number;
  ratingsGiven?: number;
  currentStreak?: number;
  winStreak?: number;
  gamesPlayed?: number;
  gamesShared?: number;
  gamesCompleted?: number;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Guest Storage Utilities ‚úÖ
**File**: `utils/guestStorage.ts`

Added RPG stat tracking functions:
- `updateRPGStat()` - Generic stat updater
- `incrementTrialPlayed()` - Updates Speed stat
- `updatePlayTime()` - Updates Accuracy stat
- `incrementRating()` - Updates Intelligence stat
- `incrementGameShared()` - Updates Charisma stat
- `updateStreak()` - Updates Defense stat
- `incrementGameCompleted()` - Updates Charisma stat

**Migration Logic**:
- New guest profiles start with all RPG stats at 0
- Existing profiles automatically migrate, converting:
  - `trialsPlayed` ‚Üí `gamesPlayed` (Speed)
  - `totalPlayTime` ‚Üí `hoursPlayed` (Accuracy)
  - Other stats default to 0 until user actions update them

### 4. Updated ProfileScreen ‚úÖ
**File**: `screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`

- Replaced `CompactStatsGrid` with `RPGStatsGrid`
- Passes stats object with fallback values for guests
- Maintains visual consistency with existing layout

## Visual Design

### Grid Layout (2x3)
```
üí™ 156        üéØ 157h
STRENGTH      ACCURACY
Lv.4          Lv.8

üß† 89         üõ°Ô∏è 12
INTELLIGENCE  DEFENSE
Lv.2          Lv.2

‚ö° 342        ‚ú® 45
SPEED         CHARISMA
Lv.7          Lv.1
```

### Styling Features
- Glass morphism effects preserved
- Subtle gradient backgrounds
- Color-coded stat values
- Compact progress bars
- Responsive sizing for different screens

## Stat Tracking Integration

### When to Update Each Stat:

1. **üí™ STRENGTH** - Increment when:
   - User likes a game: `toggleLike()` automatically updates

2. **üéØ ACCURACY** - Update when:
   - Track play time: Call `updatePlayTime(minutes)`
   - Calculated from total hours played

3. **üß† INTELLIGENCE** - Increment when:
   - User rates a game: Call `incrementRating()`

4. **üõ°Ô∏è DEFENSE** - Update when:
   - Daily login streak: Call `updateStreak(days)`
   - Maintains highest streak achieved

5. **‚ö° SPEED** - Increment when:
   - User plays a trial: Call `incrementTrialPlayed()`

6. **‚ú® CHARISMA** - Increment when:
   - User shares a game: Call `incrementGameShared()`
   - User completes a game: Call `incrementGameCompleted()`

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Grid displays 6 RPG stats correctly
- [x] Visual layout matches original grid
- [x] Guest stats initialize to 0
- [x] Existing profiles migrate properly
- [x] Level calculation works (value/50)
- [x] Progress bars display correctly
- [x] Colors and icons render properly
- [x] Glassmorphic design preserved
- [x] Responsive on different screen sizes

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In game actions
import { incrementTrialPlayed, updatePlayTime, incrementRating } from '../utils/guestStorage';

// When trial starts
await incrementTrialPlayed(); // Updates Speed

// When trial ends
await updatePlayTime(7); // Updates Accuracy (7 minutes)

// When user rates
await incrementRating(); // Updates Intelligence
```

## Migration Notes

- All existing guest profiles automatically receive RPG stats
- Legacy `trialsPlayed` maps to `gamesPlayed` (Speed)
- Legacy `totalPlayTime` converts to hours for Accuracy
- New actions required to build other stats
- Stats persist across sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Stat Bonuses**: Apply RPG stats to gameplay
2. **Achievements**: Unlock based on stat levels
3. **Leaderboards**: Compare RPG builds
4. **Stat Modifiers**: Items/power-ups that boost stats
5. **Character Classes**: Based on stat distribution

## Summary

The RPG stats grid successfully transforms boring numbers into an engaging progression system while maintaining the exact visual design and layout. Guest stats are fully tracked and migrate seamlessly. The implementation provides hooks for future gamification features while keeping the current UI clean and familiar.
