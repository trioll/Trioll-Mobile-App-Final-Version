# Character Stats Header Update

## Overview
Successfully updated the ProfileScreen section header from "Gaming DNA" to "Character Stats" and implemented the RPG attributes display with proper visual hierarchy.

## Changes Made

### 1. Section Header Update ✅
**File**: `screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`

#### Before:
```tsx
{/* RPG Stats Grid */}
<RPGStatsGrid stats={...} />

{/* Gaming DNA - Collapsible on mobile */}
<CollapsibleSection title="Gaming DNA">
```

#### After:
```tsx
{/* Character Stats - RPG Attributes */}
<CollapsibleSection
  title="Character Stats"
  defaultExpanded={true}
  style={{ marginBottom: layout.sectionSpacing }}
>
  <RPGStatsGrid stats={...} />
</CollapsibleSection>

{/* Play Style - Collapsible on mobile */}
<CollapsibleSection title="Play Style">
```

### 2. RPG Stats Grid Enhancement ✅
**File**: `components/profile/RPGStatsGrid.tsx`

Added descriptive text under each stat to clarify what it represents:
- 💪 STRENGTH → "Likes Given"
- 🎯 ACCURACY → "Time Played"
- 🧠 INTELLIGENCE → "Ratings Given"
- 🛡️ DEFENSE → "Day Streak"
- ⚡ SPEED → "Games Played"
- ✨ CHARISMA → "Games Shared"

### 3. Visual Updates ✅
- Added `statDescription` style for the descriptive text
- Increased grid item height from 90px to 100px
- Compact mode height from 80px to 90px
- Maintained glassmorphic styling throughout

## Visual Hierarchy

The profile now displays sections in this order:
1. **User Info** - Avatar, name, bio, action buttons
2. **Level Progress** - Inline progress bar (if enabled)
3. **Character Stats** - RPG attributes grid (NEW SECTION)
4. **Level & XP System** - Full level display (if not inline)
5. **Play Style** - Genre preferences and patterns (renamed from Gaming DNA)
6. **Game Library** - User's games
7. **Badges** - Achievements

## Section Naming Logic

- **"Character Stats"**: Emphasizes the RPG/gaming character aspect of the user
- **"Play Style"**: Better describes genre preferences and play patterns
- Clear distinction between stats (numbers) and preferences (behaviors)

## Character Stats Display

```
Character Stats
💪 156          🎯 157h
STRENGTH        ACCURACY
Likes Given     Time Played

🧠 89           🛡️ 12
INTELLIGENCE    DEFENSE
Ratings Given   Day Streak

⚡ 342          ✨ 45

Games Played    Games Shared
```

## Implementation Details

### CollapsibleSection Integration

- `defaultExpanded={true}` to show stats by default
- Same styling and spacing as other sections

### Preserved Features
- Glass morphism effects
- Grid layout (2x3)
- Color coding for each stat

## Summary
