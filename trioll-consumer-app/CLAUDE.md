## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **UI-First Development**: Build complete UI flows with dummy data before any backend integration
2. **Component Hierarchy**: Screens → Components → Base Components
3. **State Management**: React Context (AppContext only) for global state, local useState for component state
4. **Navigation**: React Navigation with stack navigator (no tabs implemented yet)

### Key Technical Patterns

#### Animation System

- Primary: Spring animations with predefined constants from `constants/animations.ts`
- Spring presets: BOUNCY, NORMAL, TIGHT, SOFT, QUICK, PANEL, SWIPE, SNAP_BACK
- Timing durations: FAST (150ms), QUICK (200ms), NORMAL (300ms), SLOW (400ms), RELAXED (500ms), EXTRA_SLOW (600ms)
- Stagger effects: 50-100ms delays between elements
- All animations use `useNativeDriver: true` for performance
- Haptic feedback integrated with animations

#### Component Patterns

```typescript
// Screens handle navigation and data orchestration
const Screen = () => {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  // Orchestrate components, handle navigation
};

// Components are pure UI with props
const Component = ({ onAction, data }) => {
  // Pure UI, animations, local state only
};
```

#### Mock Data Pattern

```typescript
// utils/fakeApi.ts - Simulate all backend calls
export const fetchGames = async () => {
  // Return dummy data matching real API shape
  return dummyGames;
};
```

### Critical Dependencies

- **Navigation**: Cannot use `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - use `expo-secure-store` instead
- **UI Components**: No `@react-native-community/slider` - implement custom solutions
- **Platform**: Expo SDK 53 with React Native 0.76.3
- **WebView**: react-native-webview for HTML5 game trials

### Screen Flow

1. **App.tsx** → Checks compliance → Routes to ComplianceGate or Onboarding
2. **ComplianceGateScreen** → Age verification, region selection, privacy consent → Onboarding
3. **MinimalOnboardingScreen** → Feature showcase → RegistrationMethodScreen

   - Region: `us-east-1`
   - Public read access required for profile images

2. **IAM Permissions Required**
   ```json
   // Guest Role (trioll-guest-role)
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl", "s3:DeleteObject"],
     "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::trioll-prod-uploads-us-east-1/profile-images/*"
   }
   
   // Authenticated Role (trioll-auth-role)
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
     "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::trioll-prod-uploads-us-east-1/profile-images/*"
   }
   ```

3. **S3 CORS Configuration**
   ```json
   [{
     "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
     "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
     "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
     "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
     "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
   }]
   ```

---

**🟡 CURRENT STATE**: The app is functional in development with all features working. Main blockers are code quality issues (TypeScript/ESLint) that need resolution before production deployment.

**⚠️ CRITICAL BACKEND DEPENDENCIES**:
1. S3 bucket permissions must be configured before production
2. IAM roles need updating for guest/auth user S3 access
3. CORS must be enabled on S3 bucket
4. Consider implementing image optimization Lambda for thumbnails

---

## Developer Game Upload Workflow

### How Games Get Into The App

Games appear in the Trioll Mobile app through the Developer Portal (https://triolldev.com). Here's the complete flow:

1. **Developer Registration**: Developers sign up at triolldev.com and receive a unique developer ID
2. **Game Upload**: Through the portal's upload interface, developers:
   - Fill out game metadata (name, description, category)
   - Upload HTML5 game files and assets
   - Upload a thumbnail image
   - Set game status (active/inactive)
3. **Instant Availability**: Once uploaded with status "active", games immediately appear in the mobile app
4. **Game Loading**: When users select a game, the app loads it via:
   ```javascript
   // Primary CDN URL
   const gameUrl = `https://d2wg7sn99og2se.cloudfront.net/${gameId}/index.html`;
   ```

### Mobile App Integration Points

The app integrates with uploaded games through:
- `GET /games` - Fetches all active games
- WebView configuration for HTML5 game playback
- Real-time updates via WebSocket for new games
- Analytics tracking for plays, likes, ratings

### Key Technical Details
- Games stored in S3: `trioll-prod-games-us-east-1/{gameId}/`
- Metadata in DynamoDB: `trioll-prod-games` table
- Only games with `status: "active"` shown to users
- Developer attribution displayed on game cards
